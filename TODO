* Support schema changes in SQL backend. While the right way to do this
  is to declare migrations, it would fit badly with the generic abstraction:
  we should probably just detect the simple table/attribute changes, and
  leave the more complex diffs (data-preserving attribute renaming) to
  the user.

* A Zookeeper backend would be nice.
